Monty is my Senior Capstone project.  This project is designed to create a simple Linux shell using
Python.  The reason this project was attempted is beacause Shell programming/scripting tends to be
very difficult for anyone new to the subject.  The language of choice for shell programming tends to
be C.  By switching from C to Python, someone would be able to approach this subject using a much less
difficult programming language.  Monty also has a heavy emphasis on object orientation.  By utilizing
object orientation, Monty has the added benefit of utilizing inheritance.  This project 
is intended to serve as a learning tool for people trying to break into shell programming without
wanting to use a difficult compiled language such as C, in favor of a language that is easier and has
the added benefits of object oriented programming.

The only warning with Monty is that it was designed on a system running Red Hat Linux.  It certainly
will not work in a windows environment and may even have difficulty on running on certain other 'flavors'
of Linux.
